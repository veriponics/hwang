## About This Project
'Hwang' is a passion project built using lessons from Georgia Tech's [CS 7646 Machine Learning for Trading](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-7646-machine-learning-trading) course to analyze equities based off of traditional valuation methods. The name is derived from legendary investor [Bill Hwang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Hwang), who managed to lose around $20 billion in the span of 2 days off of highly leveraged investments.

## Disclaimer
Some boring stuff to get out of the way. If you don't want to read the whole thing, the summary is this: I'm not a financial advisor, I'm especially not *your* financial advisor, and you agree to use this software at your own risk.

### Not Financial Advice
The resources available for download in `hwang` are intended for personal use only. Although the program may make certain equities seem more appealing, users should not make any investment decisions as a result, and should instead do their own independent research.

### Limited Liability
I am not a financial advisor. Investing inherently comes with risks: returns are not guaranteed, and the value of any investment may fluctuate or even lose value. I am not responsible for any losses incurred during the use of this program. By running the software, you agree to these terms.

## Getting Started
To get your copy of the program running, you're going to need an API key from AlphaVantage to pull financial data. Sign up using [this link](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key) to get your own personal key.
